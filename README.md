# TheTitanic-ML-Project by Nikul
x3 ML Model Comparison- Logistic Regression Model, K Nearest Neighbour Model, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier Model 

This Project is based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic which occured in the early morning hours of 15th April 1912. This Project is split into 4 stages which are:

1) Importing correct packages and Machine Learning models to be used
2) Data exploration of Titanic Dataset
3) Data Preprocessing of the Titanic Dataset for each Machine Learning Model
4) Running each of the 3 Machine Learning models & discovering which model is most accurate at predicting who survived and who did not survive the Titanic disaster.
